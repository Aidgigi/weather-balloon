# My Weather Ballooning Adventures

This repository exists for me to what I learn while developing the hardware and software for my high altitude weather balloon. The hardware files you find in the [Hardware](Hardware/) directory had been updated a few times since I've had the most recent PCB manufatured, but they *should* work perfectly fine. If the 5V switching supply is crap–for example–it can be fed in via the 5V breakout terminal.

The software on the other hand, doesn't really work at all for anything but debug. As of May 19th, I am still waiting for the radios to arrive and therefore haven't bothered with communication code. As I make progress on the code, I will push updates.

## To-Do
- [] Finish communication code
- [] Run range tests
- [] Finish up circuits and assemble payload
- [] Figure out wtf to do for video
- [] Launch this mf
